# Simple Banking App - Java

## Overview
This project is part of the 1st-year Semester 1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module. It serves as an implementation of key OOP concepts through a simple banking application in Java.

## Features
- User authentication
- Account creation
- Money deposits and withdrawals
- Money transfers
- File handling for user data storage

## Implementation
The project demonstrates fundamental OOP principles such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It uses a console interface to interact with users and showcases the application of Java programming in a banking context.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository. https://github.com/dinithmaleesha/genius-saver.git
2. Run the Java application.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to explore banking functionalities.


## Project Structure
The project is organized into classes, utilizing abstraction and inheritance to represent different aspects of the banking system. File handling is employed for user data storage.

## Acknowledgments
This project is a practical exercise to reinforce OOP concepts learned during the 1st-year Semester 1 OOP module. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
